# Template Recreation homework3
For this project, we are recreating a presented template to the best of our abilities using Bootstrap.  

# Why?
We as developers need to be able to take someone's ideas and translate them to a website. As for the template, giving people an easy access to make their own portfolio website and customize it is a great tool for many people.

# The Process
I started with writing out basic HTML, linking my CSS and Bootstrap to it. Then I copied the provided elements I needed for each page. For the personal styling, I used the browser inspect tool to target divs I wanted to change. Taking stock photos to fill out certain area, and lorem ipsem for text, I made the structure of the site that will show users where they can personalize elements.
